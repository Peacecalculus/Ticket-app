## 💡 Tips

### If npm install is slow:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### If port is busy:
The React app uses port 5173  
The Vue app uses port 5174  

If either is busy, Vite will auto-select another port.

### To clear data:
Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Clear
